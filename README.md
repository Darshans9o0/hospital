Hospital Management System

Welcome to the Hospital Management System, my first major project built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This application streamlines hospital operations by managing patient records, appointments, doctors, and more. It's designed to be efficient, user-friendly, and scalable, paving the way for more advanced projects in the future.

Features

Patient Management: Add, update, and view patient records.

Doctor Management: Manage doctor profiles and specialties.

Appointment Scheduling: Book, view, and manage appointments.

Authentication: Secure login and registration for staff and administrators.

Dashboard: Overview of hospital operations, including statistics and recent activity.

Technologies Used

Frontend

React: For building the user interface.

Redux: Managing global state.

Tailwind: For styling and responsive design.

Backend

Node.js: Backend runtime environment.

Express.js: Handling server-side logic and APIs.

MongoDB: Database for storing application data.

Mongoose: Object Data Modeling (ODM) for MongoDB.

Others

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure authentication.

Bcrypt: For hashing passwords.

Cloudinary :  For storing images ;

Future Plans

This project is the foundation for more complex and interactive applications. Future plans include:

Adding role-based access control.

Integrating payment systems for billing.

Implementing real-time notifications with WebSockets.

Enhancing UI/UX with advanced design practices.

Contributions

As my first major project, this is a learning journey. Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are highly welcome!
